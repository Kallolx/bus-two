Frontend Project Overview
This application is built as two separate web portals that share a common visual design (vibrant colors, rounded pills, clean look).

1. Customer Application Flow (The Public Menu)
This application is primarily a simple, one-time journey for ordering food.

Discovery (Scanning): The customer scans a QR Code. The app instantly loads the Menu Screen specific to that food court or stall.

Browsing & Customization: The customer views items organized by Categories. Tapping an item opens the Detail Screen, allowing them to add modifiers (like spiciness, extra cheese) and see the running subtotal.

Checkout & Details: When ready, they go to the Checkout Screen. Here they confirm their order items and specify their fulfillment type:

Dine-In/Takeaway: Standard pickup.

Home Delivery: Requires inputting name, phone number, and address (which the app remembers for next time).

Payment & Submission: They choose a payment method (Cash is the initial priority). After submitting, the order is sent to the kitchen.

Tracking (Real-Time): The app immediately switches to the Token/Status Screen. The customer sees a large Token Number and a Progress Timeline. This timeline updates in real-time as the staff takes action in the kitchen.

Initial State: "Waiting for Payment."

Update 1: "Food is Cooking" (once staff confirms payment).

Update 2: "Ready for Pickup!" (when the food is finished).

2. Owner/Admin Application Flow (The Management Dashboard)
This application is protected by a login and serves as the staff's control center, relying heavily on real-time data updates.

A. Order Processing
The main screen is the Order Management Dashboard, organized by tabs:

Incoming/New: Shows new orders. Staff selects an order card, verifies cash payment with the customer, and clicks "Confirm Payment & Start Prep." This action instantly updates the customer's status screen to "Food is Cooking."

Cooking/Pending: Shows active orders being prepared. Staff clicks "Mark as Complete" when the dish is ready.

Ready/Complete: Shows fulfilled orders, which eventually clear out.

Delivery: A filtered version of the orders tab, showing only Home Delivery orders that require dispatch.

B. Inventory Management
The Inventory Dashboard shows all ingredients and stock levels.

Alerts: Red Alerts prominently appear at the top for any item below the set "low stock threshold."

Stock Adjustment: Staff can quickly add or subtract stock when deliveries arrive.

Smart Deduction (System Trigger): When a staff member moves an order to the "Cooking" or "Complete" status, the system automatically subtracts the required ingredients (based on the recipe) from the inventory.

C. Menu & Recipe Setup
The Menu Editor is where the digital menu is built and linked to inventory:

Item Creation: Staff creates a dish (price, name, category).

Recipe Linking: When creating/editing a dish, the staff can optionally open a section to define the Recipe, linking the dish to specific Inventory Items (e.g., 1 serving of Biryani requires 200g Rice and 1 Chicken leg).

D. Settings & Configuration
The Settings Screen allows the owner to control the shop's operational status and view their plan:

Shop Toggles: Simple switches to turn on/off features instantly, like Enable Home Delivery or Accept New Orders.

Billing: Shows the current subscription plan (Free, Student, or Enterprise) and links to billing history.
